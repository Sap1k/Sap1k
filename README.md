### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
#### I mostly focus all sorts of opendata-related projects, and I sometimes venture into maintaining Android Custom ROMs or other various projects :)

âš¡Languages I can actually write code in
- Python
- C, C++
- C# .NET
- Visual Basic for Applications
- Bash

ðŸŒ± How do I spend my free time?
- At Uni
- Working on my own projects
- At work writing VBA code and bashing my head against the wall because of 20 year old Excel spreadsheets
- Hanging out with my friends IRL
- And of course, I can't forget Android, which has been eating up my time in some way, shape or form since 2018 :)
