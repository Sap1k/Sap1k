### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
#### I mostly focus on maintaining Android Custom ROMs, but I like to venture out every once in a while :)

âš¡Languages I can actually write code in
- Python
- C++
- Visual Basic for Applications
- Bash

ðŸŒ± How do I spend my free time?
- At school
- At work writing VBA code and bashing my head against the wall because of 20 year old Excel spreadsheets
- Hanging out with my friends IRL now that COVID is practically gone
- And of course, I can't forget Android, which has been eating up my time in some way, shape or form since 2018 :)
